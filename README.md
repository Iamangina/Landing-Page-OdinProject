# Landing-Page-OdinProject
The project from the Odin Project course presents a homepage and demonstrates basic knowledge of HTML and CSS. 
In this project, I used the Flexbox technique, which makes it easier to structure the page. 
I created the page based on an image from the course, and it now serves as a template to which I will start adding other elements in an attempt to build a real website.
