# Landing-Page-OdinProject
The project from the Odin Project course presents a homepage and demonstrates basic knowledge of HTML and CSS. 

In this project, I used the Flexbox technique, which makes it easier to structure the page.

I created the page based on an image from the course and I have attached photos and slightly changed the appearance of the page. 

My finished webpage for this project https://iamangina.github.io/Landing-Page-OdinProject/

P.S. The webpage is not responsive because it's beyond the purpose of this project.
